#BLE API

The BLE module within mbed OS offers a high level abstraction for using
Bluetooth Low Energy on multiple platforms.

This documentation describes the internal structure of mbed
(BLE_API)[https://github.com/armmbed/ble]. It was automatically generated from
specially formatted comment blocks in BLE_API's source code using Doxygen.
(See http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ for more information on Doxygen).

For getting started with BLE on mbed, check our (introduction
page)[https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/].

For mbed OS examples using BLE, check (this
repository)[https://github.com/armmbed/ble-examples]. For mbed-classic
examples, refer to (code under mbed.org)[https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/code/].
