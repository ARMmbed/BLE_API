#BLE API

The BLE module within mbed OS offers a high abstraction level for using
Bluetooth Low Energy on multiple platforms.

This documentation describes the internal structure of the mbed
[BLE API](https://github.com/armmbed/ble). It was automatically generated from
specially formatted comment blocks in BLE API's source code using Doxygen (see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ for more information on Doxygen).

For getting started with BLE on mbed, check our [introduction
page](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/).

For mbed OS examples using BLE, check [this
repository](https://github.com/armmbed/ble-examples). For mbed-classic
examples, please refer to [code under mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/code/).
